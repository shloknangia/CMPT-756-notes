This slide deck discusses salt tolerance in distributed systems. It covers topics such as different types of faults, how to prevent and detect them, and how to recover from them. It also includes data from real-world data center networks about the percentage of time that failures occur.

This paper discusses how to recover from transient faults in a system using micro reboots. The paper argues that this is a practical solution to better performance with low maintenance tasks.

In a distributed system, each system has its own state machine that is a replica of the other systems. The purpose of this is to keep the system running even if some of the servers fail. The way this is done is by logging each of the commands that are run on the system.

The purpose of a consensus algorithm is to come to agreement on what the next command should be, in order to ensure that all machines are in the same state. The algorithm is complex, but it boils down to each machine agreeing on a value. This value must be agreed upon by the majority of machines in order for it to be accepted.

The consensus problem is the problem of getting a group of processes to agree on a value. The requirements for consensus are that all non-faulty processes agree on the same value, and that the value is valid (i.e. all non-faulty processes must agree on it).

A group of friends use the Paxos algorithm to decide what to do on a Friday night. The algorithm requires two rounds of communication in order to reach a consensus. In the first round, the proposer contacts each individual to see if they agree with the proposal. In the second round, the agreed-upon value is communicated between the group.

Unicast communication is a type of communication where each system is contacted one by one. In education, this is like if you think about a system, this is like unicast communication where each system is contacted one by one to figure out if they are doing and also inform them about what is happening. Okay, so we call the first phrase promise phase. So you called your friends and your friend promised that they are going to agree with your proposal of going to movies. The second phase is called the accept phase, where after promising that you will do this, we are talking about yes, this is the decision that we come up with and we can call it accept the whole thing. Or the last one we can call it learn as well because this person, the friend who was not reachable at first, just learned about the decision to then contribute to that decision. Right? So they didn't even accept as well, but because others accepted and this person was a minority, they had to accept what happened. What if we like the person who didn't actually receive that now receive the initial phone call when the second friend contacted them? They actually had a different proposal. So let's say we do the same thing. We call your friend saying do you want to go to the movies and the first friend responds yes, the other does not respond. And then because you still have a majority, but this friend doesn't know doesn't even know like didn't pick up the call, right? They doesn't even know that you reach the consensus of going to a movie, right? So this friend this time like picks up the phone and maybe at the same time your other friend is calling you and your friend asking do you want to go to the concert tonight because a good concert is happening and they don't even know about the consensus that has happened before on movies. And you think about that and you think actually this is a better decision maybe we should go with this decision instead of movies, right? So you replace that decision by this new decision. Your friend agrees as well. So you have a new consensus on a new thing before you finalize the previous consensus. You change the value there. So you had here two promise phases like the previous promise phase finished when one of your friends made a promise to you but the other friend was not even available to pick up the phone to do before you get to the accept phase and finalize your decision another promise phase started and you basically change your decision based on the new proposal. So we had one promise phase another promise phase then the accept happens on the second promise phase which means on the second value that was proposed and then both of the people basically learn that the accepted value is the second value not the previous value. So in context, this relates to leader election where we discussed that if a majority of people agree on something, then it becomes the consensus even if someone disagrees with it.

Paxos is an algorithm used for distributed systems to come to a conclusion. It is complex because it leaves many decisions open for implementation, and because the original paper is written in a way that is difficult to understand.

The safety requirements for Paxos is that only one value that has been proposed may be chosen, and that value must be proposed by someone. Every time the consensus algorithm is run, only one decision can be made. This means that replicated state machines can only apply one decision at a time. The algorithm also ensures that no value is chosen unless it is actually proposed, and that no process learns of a value being chosen unless it has been proposed.

This passage discusses the potential problems that can arise when using Paxos for fault tolerance in a distributed system. Specifically, it notes that Paxos may not work as intended if agents are working at different speeds or if there is a possibility of a restart. Additionally, the passage notes that communication links in a distributed system are not always reliable, which can lead to lost or delayed messages.

The Paxos system is designed to add fault tolerance to a system by allowing for replication of messages and discarding of duplicate messages. The system is designed to work well even in situations where some nodes may fail or malfunction.

The algorithm proposed in the paper is designed to ensure that a single value is chosen as the final decision, while also ensuring that any higher-numbered proposals that are accepted by a majority of acceptors have value V. The fourth condition ensures that the final decision is made by a majority of acceptors, and not just by one or two acceptors.

The paxos algorithm is a way of reaching consensus in a distributed system. In the first phase, a proposal is sent to a majority of the acceptors. If an acceptor receives a prepare request with the biggest number, they promise not to accept any more proposal numbers less than that. In the second phase, the proposal sends an accept request to a majority of the acceptors. If they receive it, they promise to accept the value.

The algorithm consists of two rounds of requests and responses. In the first round, the proposer sends prepare requests to all of the nodes in the system. If a majority of the nodes respond positively to the request, the proposer sends an accept request to the majority in the second round. If an acceptor receives an accept request with a proposal number that is higher than any other prepare request it has received, it will respond positively to the request. Otherwise, it will accept the request. This process continues until a majority of the nodes have agreed on a value, at which point the algorithm terminates.

Paxos is a distributed consensus algorithm that allows a group of nodes to agree on a single value. The algorithm proceeds in two phases: the first phase, called the prepare phase, involves nodes proposing values; the second phase, called the accept phase, involves nodes voting on the proposed values. The value with the most votes is accepted as the consensus value.

The algorithm is designed to be fault tolerant, meaning that if a node proposing something fails, another node can take over and continue the process. The algorithm reaches a consensus by majority vote. If a majority of nodes vote for a certain value, that value is accepted. If there is no majority, the algorithm continues until a majority is reached.

If one of the acceptors fails during the accept phase, the majority of the nodes can still carry on. If the sets of nodes that responded to the prepare requests no longer has a majority, then the algorithm will not be able to continue.

The algorithm is designed to allow for nodes to respond in the first phase, by receiving an accept request. This way, a majority can be reached by other nodes in the system. However, if a majority is not reached, the algorithm still allows for the possibility of getting a majority by other nodes responding to the accept request.

Paxos is an algorithm that allows for a set of nodes to agree on a value. It does this by having a set of acceptors who each have a value that they are willing to accept. When a new proposal comes in, the acceptors compare it to the values they have and if it is higher, they accept it. If it is lower, they reject it. This process repeats until the acceptors all have the same value, at which point the proposal is accepted.

The paxos algorithm is a consensus algorithm that is used to reach agreement on logs in a replicated state machine. It is designed to tolerate non- Byzantine faults, and is therefore suitable for use in systems with failover capabilities. The algorithm works by sending requests to all nodes in the system and then responding to the node that initiates the request. The number of messages exchanged in each phase is linear with the number of nodes in the system.

The Raft algorithm is an algorithm that has a strong leader and is simpler and more defined than the Paxos algorithm. It is more reliable and easier to understand. It uses heartbeat messages to make sure that the leader is reachable. It also has safety features that prevent different servers from applying different commands for the same log index.

Paxos is a complex algorithm used for distributed systems. It is similar to The Raft in that it uses a prepare/accept phase to propose values. However, Paxos is more complex in that it uses a value of n to decide the value of the command, rather than the actual value itself. This makes it more difficult to implement.

The professor says that everything needed for the exam will be covered in Thursday's session, and that there will be an optional retake exam for anyone who has trouble passing next Tuesday. They also recommend not using search engines during the exam.
