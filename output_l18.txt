We are discussing non-Byzantine fault tolerance and how to design systems that can withstand process and link failures. We will also talk about how to come to consensus in the event of a failure and some popular algorithms for doing so.

The Byzantine Generals Problem is a problem that discusses the issue of troops divided into different sections around a city, where they must communicate with each other to make a decision on whether to attack or retreat. The problem is that the communication between the troops is not trustable, and thus the troops may come to different decisions and lose the battle.

The communication system between the different parts of a troop is reliable, but the content of the messages may be changed by the source. The system is designed to start from a general and work down to the lieutenants, who may be loyal or traders. If a trader general is in the system, they may give conflicting commands to different lieutenants.

The decision right which is which is a problem to our system because we want we said that we want to reach the same conclusion and for lieutenant as well if they receive the command from the commander a general if they can actually relay it in a wrong order if they are Traders otherwise if they're loyal they are going to obey and they are going to replicate the same message to others so we want to see what is the situation that happens in this condition.

The paper discusses the impossibility of reaching a consensus when there are Byzantine faults present. It proves that if there are M traitors in the system, then we would need 3+m+1 generals to be able to cope with the situation. Therefore, if we want to tolerate one fault, we need at least 4 systems.

The army around the Byzantine area will not break down because the algorithm in place will ensure that commands are obeyed and relayed correctly. The use case for this system is to provide authenticity for messages. Adding a signature to a message will allow others to verify that it came from the correct source. The number of traitors that can be tolerated in this system is limited.

We can use digital signatures to create competing systems that are similar to the ones we have in place. These systems can be used to create file systems and peer-to-peer systems that are tolerant of different kinds of faults. The main benefit of these systems is that they are self-organizing, meaning that we don't need a central authority to coordinate them.

A peer-to-peer system is one in which there is no central authority controlling all of the nodes, and instead each node plays a role in controlling the system as a whole. This type of system has many benefits, including the ability to use resources more efficiently and the ability to find resources faster and easier. However, there are also many challenges associated with peer-to-peer systems, including the need for efficient management of churn (the rate at which nodes leave and join the system).

The implications of using peer-to-peer storage systems are that decisions about server location and connectivity cannot be made in advance, and that redundancy and communication paths must be taken into account.

The article discusses blockchain technology and how it can be used to create a distributed public ledger for recording transactions. It explains how this can be useful for Byzantine fault tolerance and how it can be used to remove the need for central identification.

The article discusses how blockchain works and how it is different from traditional banking systems. With blockchain, there is no central authority managing transactions. Instead, transactions are verified by a network of nodes, and consensus is reached through a process called contract smart contract.

The Bitcoin system creates money by turning something with monetary value into money. However, this trustless consensus system is not without its flaws. For example, coinbase allows users to invest in cryptocurrencies without being a part of the system, thereby centralizing authority.

The crypto kitties game is a popular game that uses blockchain technology. The game is a good way to learn about coding and blockchain. The game is based on buying and building an army of crypto zombies that are fed with crypts or kitties. The game is a good way to learn about solidity and blockchain.

The application of two pieces of information, one of which is a public key, can result in a middle piece of data that is unrecognizable by anyone except for the person with the private key. This allows for secure communication between parties.

The public key is used to encrypt a message so that only the person with the private key can decrypt it. This allows for secure communication between parties and can also be used like a signature to prove that a message came from a specific person.

The Bitcoin network is a decentralized system for keeping track of transactions. It uses a blockchain, which is a ledger of all transactions that have taken place. The blockchain is stored on every node in the network, and each node has a copy of the entire blockchain. When a new transaction is made, it is added to the blockchain.

The Bitcoin network is a decentralized network of nodes, each of which stores a record of all transactions that have taken place. To ensure that all nodes have the same information, the network uses a data structure called a "miracle tree." Each block in the chain contains a pointer to the previous block, a hash of the previous block, and a timestamp.

The transaction has happened, and we like to keep things that are called bits and nods, which is basically controlling elements on how we are going to come to consensus on building this block about proof of work that we will discuss in a bit. Any questions? We do have a quiz, but it's not going to be as complicated as an exam. So, let's talk about Miracle root of transactions. What do we do? Say I have a transaction. There are different types of transactions in Bitcoin. How do we make Miracle roots to put on each of those blocks that we are making? So, remember, each of the transactions that we are doing is in the form of "get ten dollars from Alice, give it to Bob." If we write it in a ledger, it's a very long list of transactions that we are doing. We add it to the block and compute the hash of the block. We keep the hash of the block so that the current hash of the previous block in the current block that we are making doesn't change. But in order to have all of the history of this blockchain in hand when we run it in a compact form, we come up with a tree architecture. Say transactions A, B, and C have happened in this blockchain. We hash those transactions, put them in nodes, and build a binary tree architecture. At each node, we hash the two leave nodes. We start with the leaf nodes, put those transactions together, take the hash, make a new node, and then combine combine combine till we get to the root of that tree. What we keep in that block that we are making is only the hash of that root. This mechanism can use different hashing algorithms, but in Bitcoin specifically, it uses sha-256. It is just a mechanism to have a track of everything that has happened in the network with a very compact thing which is the root of the tree. So if anything changes in any of the transactions in the tree, The Root is not going to be exactly the same, right? It is a check mechanism for you to keep in the block so that you can basically make sure that this block is made on that long history of transactions without actually referring to the whole list of transactions.

The goal of a blockchain network is to come to a consensus about a particular decision (e.g. that a transaction has occurred). However, this can be difficult to achieve if there are malicious actors who are trying to propagate incorrect information or add incorrect data to the network. To overcome this, blockchain networks rely on proof-of-work mechanisms to ensure that only valid transactions are included in the final consensus.

A blockchain network consists of a series of blocks, each of which contains information about transactions that have occurred. In order to add a new block to the chain, miners must solve a puzzle, which is designed to be difficult to solve but easy to verify. The difficulty of the puzzle is determined by the "bits" parameter, which determines the maximum number of tries that can be made in solving the puzzle.

The article discusses the concept of "proof of work" in the context of the Bitcoin network. Proof of work is a way of ensuring that a transaction is valid by requiring the person initiating the transaction to do some work (in this case, finding a hash that meets certain requirements). This work is easy to verify but hard to do, which helps to prevent fraud. When a block is found that meets the requirements, the person who found it announces it to the network, and everyone can then verify that it is a valid block.

The class will have presentations on blockchain and distributed peer-to-peer networks next Thursday. Students are encouraged to think about how these concepts can be applied to real-world scenarios, such as building a distributed storage system.
