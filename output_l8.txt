The CAP theorem states that it is impossible to have all three of the following in a distributed system: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. However, recent developments have allowed for systems that are built on the CAP theorem to be more available. This is because availability can be expressed in terms of latency, rather than availability. Replication is introduced in order to achieve availability, but this creates the problem of consistency. Partitioning is introduced when replication is across wide area networks.

We have three different scenarios for replicating data, and each one affects availability and consistency in different ways. In the first scenario, we send updates to all replicas at the same time, with or without a preprocessor. This can introduce latency, but all replicas will receive the updates in the same order. In the second scenario, we send updates to one agreed-upon location first, then replicate asynchronously or synchronously from there. This can improve performance but may cause some replicas to lag behind others. In the third scenario, we send updates to one arbitrary node. This is less reliable but may be faster.

We are discussing partition tolerance and how it affects replicas across wide area networks. If there is a wide area network between replicas, there is a partition. We are talking about replication here, so each replica has a full copy of the database.

Different kinds of concurrent update screens can cause problems with replication, either by creating inconsistency or by causing latency. A hybrid solution may help to alleviate some of these problems.

The latency and consistency of foreign objects will be exactly the same, so we have one more minute to discuss. For the last set of questions of the day, ask me if you have any questions about this. Turn to your friend for the last minute and explain one of these scenarios to the person next to you. Ask me if you have any questions in the class.
