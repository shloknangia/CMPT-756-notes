​

Hello everyone, We are Group 11, ​

And our project topic is comparing serverless and serverfull implementation using microsrvice architecture,​

And my team includes, myself, gaurav, song, jialang and timmy​



2: (~30-40 Seconds)​

​

We stared with creating a simple microservices application to replicate a e-commerce platform.​

We created a fancy store applcation with 2 microservices to maintain Orders and products in our App.​

Our frontend application is in React which talks to Node js REST APIs and the data is stored in NOSQL DB​

As you can see the design both of our microservices supports basic crud operations and have a separate DB ​

​

3: (~60-90 Seconds)​

​

So in our serverless approach we used google cloud functions to deploy our microservices ans Firestore DB which is a NOSQL DB.​

As cloud functions scale with respect to number of invocations, so we will be charged with respect to requests​ or whenever the function runs

​

And in serverfull approach we created 3 VMs , 1 for each service. So each Vm has code for running microservices and has Mongo Db installed so that Node js app can talk to DB.​

And in VM based approach we just need to keep out VMs active/alive the whole time we want out application up and running​




4 : (~60-90 Seconds)​

​

Here, on this slide we can compare both the deployment starategies, with respect to response time, throughput and Cost​

​

So we deployed 2 Serverfull models, one with bad/not so good configuration VMs and other one with better configuration virtual machines.​

In the first table you can see the numbers highlighted​

​

For a GET request returning all the orders​

At the top, high config VM takes 71ms, serverless take about 78ms whereas not so good config VM take 92 ms ​

​

​

Comparing our strategies for all the API endpoints tested, the graph will give you a better picture​

So high config VM performs slightly better than serverless model, but just slightly, whereas serverless performs much better then low config VM.​

You can even see that serverless take a little time in the starting when the machines boot but as the no.of requests increase the avg response time reduces.​

​

Comparing the cost of these implementations​

​

running these VMs for a month ,  High comfig VM takes about 60 USD, low config takes 25 USD

Whereas for serverless approach we are charged per traffic, so for running about a milllion requests it cost around 3USD only.​

​

​


And All the numbers you see here are calculated using load and performance testing platforms such as artillery and grafana​ which can be used for high load testing , as you can see we tested using more than 4 hund thousand requests and data generated can be fed to pandas to visualize data



Thank You Everyone
Thats it from our side
